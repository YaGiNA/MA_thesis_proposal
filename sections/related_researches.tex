To detect \& classify fake news is not a new topic because it is so similar to detecting spam\cite{shen2017discovering}, rumor\cite{7023340}, and illegal advertisement\cite{Huang:2017:DFO:3041021.3054233}.
Following some previous works\cite{Shu:2017:FND:3137597.3137600,Ruchansky:2017:CHD:3132847.3132877,Wang:2018:EEA:3219819.3219903}, we define fake news as news which is intentionally fabricated and can be verified as false.
