\section{Related Works}
To detect \& classify fake news is not a new topic because it is so similar to detecting spam\cite{shen2017discovering}, rumor\cite{7023340}, and illegal advertisement\cite{Huang:2017:DFO:3041021.3054233}.
Following some previous works\cite{Shu:2017:FND:3137597.3137600,Ruchansky:2017:CHD:3132847.3132877,Wang:2018:EEA:3219819.3219903}, we define fake news as news which is intentionally fabricated and can be verified as false.

%Text classify
There are many works which detect fake news with only news content.
In text feature, writing styles\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/PotthastKRBS17} and amount of emotions\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1903-01728}
were considered because commonly fake news have original styles \& emotions.
In addition, using deep neural network achieved better results in classification on some works\cite{wang-2017-liar,karimi-tang-2019-learning,karimi-etal-2018-multi}.
% w/ social context
There are also many works which consider social context of news content.
Social context feature was generated by user-based\cite{Castillo:2011:ICT:1963405.1963500,8397048,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1904-13355}, 
post-based\cite{Yang2019UnsupervisedFN,Tacchini2017SomeLI,Jin:2016:NVE:3016100.3016318},
and network-based\cite{Wu:2018:TFF:3159652.3159677,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1902-06673}.

Considering social context, it must wait moments from posted because social contexts are made by users which are exposed.
Therefore,  Two-Level Convolutional Neural Network with User Response Generator(TCNN-URG) are proposed\cite{ijcai2018-533}.
This generates comment by hidden variables which are trained by probably distribution of comment appearance.
Generating comments can give additional information to classify posts and get even if news are just posted.
However, this generates only words which have high probably of appearance and there are no grammar elements.

%seq-gan
In generating natural language sentences, Seq-GAN is proposed\cite{Yu:2017:SSG:3298483.3298649}.
This is arranged from GAN in order to apply natural language processing and this has also generator and classifier(discriminator).
Classifier of Seq-GAN try to classify text which is real or generated.
Generator create text from classification results and text features from classifier.
In this work, we will arrange it for generating comments which will be post for news article.
